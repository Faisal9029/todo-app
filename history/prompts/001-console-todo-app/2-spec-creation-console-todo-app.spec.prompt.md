Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application

Context:
This is Phase I of the "Evolution of Todo" project. The goal is to build a Python console-based Todo application using Spec-Driven Development. All code must be generated by Claude Code and must strictly follow the Phase I Constitution.

System Scope:
- Python 3.13+
- Console-based user interaction only
- In-memory data storage
- No external libraries beyond Python standard library
- No persistence, APIs, web frameworks, or AI features

Functional Requirements:

1. Add Task
- User can create a new task
- Required input: title
- Optional input: description
- Task ID must auto-increment
- Default completion status: false

2. View Task List
- Display all tasks in the console
- Each task must show:
  - ID
  - Title
  - Completion status ([ ] or [x])

3. Update Task
- User can update title and/or description
- Task is selected using ID
- Invalid IDs must show an error message

4. Delete Task
- User can delete a task by ID
- Confirmation message must be displayed
- Invalid IDs must not crash the system

5. Mark Task Complete / Incomplete
- User can toggle completion status
- Task is selected using ID
- Status change must be immediately visible in task list

User Interface Contract:
- Show a numbered menu:
  1. Add Task
  2. View Tasks
  3. Update Task
  4. Delete Task
  5. Mark Complete / Incomplete
  6. Exit
- Program must loop until user selects Exit
- All errors must be handled gracefully
- No stack traces shown to user

Data Model:
Task:
- id: int (unique, auto-increment)
- title: str (required, non-empty)
- description: str (optional)
- completed: bool (default False)

Architecture Constraints:
- Separate concerns between:
  - Console UI
  - Business logic
  - In-memory storage
- No global logic in main loop
- Deterministic behavior

Acceptance Criteria:
- All five features function correctly
- App runs without crashing
- Clear console output
- Code structure supports future phases

Output Expectations:
- Generate Python source code only
- Create a clean project structure under /src
- Do not include tests
- Do not include unused features

Clarification Policy:
If any requirement is ambiguous, stop and ask before implementing.
```

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive feature specification for the Phase I In-Memory Python Console Todo Application. The specification includes:

- 6 user stories with priorities (P1-P2) covering all core functionality
- Detailed acceptance scenarios for each user story
- Edge cases handling invalid inputs and error conditions
- 14 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-014) covering all specified functionality
- Key entity definition for the Task data model
- 7 measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-007)

The specification follows the template structure and captures all requirements from the feature description while maintaining focus on user value and business needs without implementation details. A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification completeness.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive spec for console todo app with clear requirements
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Planning and implementation of the console todo application
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification captures all requirements with clear acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all requirements captured
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning the implementation
