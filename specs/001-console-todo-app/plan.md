# Implementation Plan: Console Todo Application

**Branch**: `001-console-todo-app` | **Date**: 2026-01-04 | **Spec**: specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a Phase I in-memory Python console Todo application following the spec-driven foundation approach. The application will provide core task management features (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete) through a menu-driven console interface, with strict separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data storage layers. All data will be stored in-memory only with no persistence.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
**Storage**: In-memory only (no persistence, no databases)
**Testing**: No automated tests required for Phase I (manual validation only)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application
**Project Type**: Single project (console application)
**Performance Goals**: Fast response times for all operations (under 100ms)
**Constraints**: No external libraries, no persistence, no web frameworks, console-only interface
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, local application with reasonable task limits (up to 1000 tasks)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **Spec-Driven Foundation**: All functionality must strictly follow the approved specification
2. **AI-Only Code Generation**: All code must be generated by Claude Code (no manual coding)
3. **Specification Authority**: No features beyond those specified may be implemented
4. **Functional Scope Adherence**: Only the five core features (Add, Delete, Update, View, Mark Complete) are allowed
5. **Data & Storage Constraints**: In-memory storage only, no persistence mechanisms
6. **Architectural Separation**: Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data storage
7. **Console Interaction Contract**: Interface must be menu-driven with numbered options
8. **Error Handling Robustness**: All errors must be handled gracefully without crashes
9. **Evolution Compatibility**: Implementation must support future phases with persistence, APIs, etc.
10. **AI Agent Conduct**: Claude Code must follow all constitutional requirements

# No tests required for Phase I
```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure selected with clear separation of concerns. The application follows a layered architecture with models, storage, services, and UI components in separate modules under the src/ directory. This structure supports the constitutional requirement of separation between UI, business logic, and data storage.
